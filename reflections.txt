# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

   - Approximately 5 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

   - Creating module Typeable which was used for the filtering
     and also for the displaying of item types

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

   - Feature 1 - the list can be printed and used as check list.  Why? Makes
                 the program more usable as I don't need my computer for list

   - Feature 2 - user can change the due date.  Why? Often dates change and
                 this is a practical feature to help the user manage their list

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

   - Learning more about OOP and how it can be implemented in Ruby
   - Getting more comfortable with the different types of modules
